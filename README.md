# Embedded-RaspberryPI-Pin Management
 
1. Mprov64.s

This assembly program prompts the user to input five integers, performs a sum of these integers, and displays the result. It showcases basic input/output operations, loop control, and conditional jumps in assembly language.

2. counter_S.S

This code functions as an interrupt handler that increments a counter every time an interrupt occurs. The counter's value triggers different actions based on predefined thresholds, controlling GPIO pins. This demonstrates handling interrupts and basic I/O control in a low-level assembly environment.

3. Code.s

This assembly code facilitates basic input and output operations through managing buffers. It includes functions for reading integers, characters, and strings from input, as well as for writing them out. The code handles ASCII value checks and manipulates string and integer data, illustrating fundamental operations such as loops, conditions, and buffer management.
